        //difficulties related to this code, players = [player1, player2, player3, player4, player5, player6]: how to determine the order? I (Jeewoo) thought it would be good idea for making the players array that keep tracts of whose turn it is. For example, playerOfTurn: players[0], nextPlayerOfTurn: players[1]. I expected the values of array to point same memory location as other players since instances of classes are reference types. However, it turns out as those hands(players) are stored in array, it creates copy of those players that it does not point same memory location anymore. I assume it's because collections in swift are value types.

        //initialize middle which is instance of Hand class
        middle = Hand(description: "middle")
        //Initialize Deck
        deck = Deck()
        //Initialize actual deck that will be used in actual game
        actualDeck = Deck()
        //empty the array of actaulDeck because we want it to have no cards before user determine how many people they would like to play with.
        actualDeck.reset()
        
        //set possibleNumber; number of players as 0 before user input
        var possibleNumber = 0
        //get user input for possibleNumber of players.
